abstract: Learning versatile whole-body skills by tracking various human motions is a fundamental step toward general-purpose humanoid robots. This task is particularly challenging because a single policy must master a broad repertoire of motion skills while ensuring stability over long-horizon sequences. To this end, we present VMS, a unified whole-body controller that enables humanoid robots to learn diverse and dynamic behaviors within a single policy. Our framework integrates a hybrid tracking objective that balances local motion fidelity with global trajectory consistency, and an Orthogonal Mixture of Experts (OMoE) architecture that encourages skill specialization while enhancing generalization across motions. A segment-level tracking reward is further introduced to relax rigid step-wise matching, enhancing robustness when handling global displacements and transient inaccuracies. We validate VMS extensively in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating accurate imitation of dynamic skills, stable performance over minute-long sequences, and strong generalization to unseen motions. These results highlight the potential of VMS as a scalable foundation for versatile humanoid whole-body control.
