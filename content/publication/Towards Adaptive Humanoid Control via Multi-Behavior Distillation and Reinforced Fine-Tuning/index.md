abstract: This paper presents a framework for adaptive humanoid control by leveraging multi-behavior distillation and reinforced fine-tuning. The proposed method enables humanoid robots to learn a diverse set of motion skills from multiple demonstrations and adaptively switch between behaviors in complex environments. Through multi-behavior distillation, the robot acquires versatile skills, and reinforced fine-tuning further improves robustness and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in dynamic humanoid control tasks and is recommended as an AAAI-26 Oral presentation.

summary: We propose a framework for adaptive humanoid control via multi-behavior distillation and reinforced fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance and AAAI-26 Oral recommendation.
