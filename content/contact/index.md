          I am currently seeking <span style="color:IndianRed"><strong>Research Interns</strong></span> who are enthusiastic about cutting-edge areas of AI, with the goal of publishing high-quality papers or creating exciting robot demos based on the proof-of-concept algorithms developed by our team. The research interests of <a href="https://baichenjia.github.io/people/">our team</a> include:
          
          -	<strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: This includes Domain Generalization, Exploration, Skill Discovery, Offline optimization, Preference Learning and RLHF, Representation Learning, as well as understanding the theoretical perspectives of RL algorithms.
          
          -	<strong>Embodied AI</strong>: This includes Diffusion/Transformer Policy, World Model, Robust Policy, LLM/VLM-driven Embodied Planning/Policy/Reward, Agent-Environment Alignment/Interactions. The physical robot platforms we use include <strong>Humanoid, Quadruped Robots, and Dexterous Hands</strong>.
          
          The resulting work aims to produce high-quality papers and demos for leading machine learning conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) or robotics conferences (e.g., RSS, CoRL, ICRA). We will provide generous internship salaries, hardware platforms, computing resources, and research guidance.
          <br><br>

          If you have a strong background in machine learning, computer science, robotics, or related fields, and are eager to contribute to pioneering research, I would love to hear from you. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:baichenjia255@gmail.com">contact me</a> with an attached CV.
